# Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot - MEV Implementation

A sophisticated flash loan arbitrage system designed for educational purposes and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) research. This project demonstrates automated arbitrage execution between decentralized exchanges using flash loans to eliminate capital requirements.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as an educational template for understanding:
- Flash loan mechanics and implementation
- Cross-DEX arbitrage opportunities
- MEV strategies in DeFi
- Smart contract development for arbitrage
- Automated trading bot architecture

**‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Use Only**: This code is provided for learning purposes and to document the development journey. Use at your own risk.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (`ArbitrageExecutor.sol`)
- **ERC-3156 Flash Loan Integration**: Implements standard flash loan interface
- **Multi-DEX Support**: Generic router implementation for any Uniswap V2-compatible DEX
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient execution path with minimal gas overhead
- **Slippage Protection**: Built-in safeguards against unfavorable price movements
- **Profit Calculation**: Real-time profitability verification before execution

### Python Bot (`arbitrage_bot.py`)
- **Continuous Market Scanning**: Real-time opportunity detection across multiple token pairs
- **Gas Price Monitoring**: Intelligent gas price management to maintain profitability
- **Risk Management**: Configurable profit thresholds and position sizing
- **Automated Execution**: Optional auto-execution with manual override capability
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operation logs for analysis and debugging

## üîß Key Features

### Smart Contract Features
- **Flash Loan Execution**: Zero-capital arbitrage using borrowed funds
- **Multi-Router Architecture**: Support for any DEX with Uniswap V2 interface
- **Direction Flexibility**: Bidirectional arbitrage (Router1‚ÜíRouter2 or Router2‚ÜíRouter1)
- **Safety Checks**: Multiple validation layers and revert conditions
- **Profit Extraction**: Automatic profit distribution to specified receiver

### Bot Features
- **Multi-Token Support**: Simultaneous monitoring of multiple token pairs
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime adjustment of parameters without restart
- **Gas Optimization**: Smart gas price limits and transaction timing
- **Opportunity Ranking**: Automatic selection of most profitable opportunities
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and automatic restart mechanisms

## üìã Prerequisites

### Development Environment
```bash
# Solidity Development
- Solidity ^0.8.20
- OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Hardhat/Truffle/Foundry

# Python Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Web3.py
- eth-account
- python-dotenv
- asyncio
```

### Required Setup
1. **Environment Variables**: Create `.env` file with required API keys and private keys
2. **Contract Deployment**: Deploy `ArbitrageExecutor` contract to target network
3. **Configuration**: Update contract addresses and token pairs in bot configuration
4. **Flash Loan Provider**: Ensure access to ERC-3156 compatible flash loan provider

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Contract Deployment
```solidity
// Deploy with your flash loan provider and target DEX routers
constructor(
    IERC3156FlashLender _lender,    // Your flash loan provider
    IUniswapV2Router02 _router1,    // First DEX router
    IUniswapV2Router02 _router2     // Second DEX router
)
```

### 2. Bot Configuration
```python
# Update configuration variables
ARBITRAGER_ADDRESS = "0xYourDeployedContract"
ROUTER1_ADDRESS = "0xFirstDEXRouter"
ROUTER2_ADDRESS = "0xSecondDEXRouter"

# Configure your target tokens
TOKEN1 = "0xTokenAddress1"
TOKEN2 = "0xTokenAddress2"
# ... add more tokens
```

### 3. Execution
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the bot
python arbitrage_bot.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Runtime Parameters
- **Scan Interval**: Time between opportunity scans (default: 60s)
- **Profit Threshold**: Minimum profit percentage to execute (default: 0.15%)
- **Gas Price Limit**: Maximum gas price for execution (default: 80 gwei)
- **Flash Loan Amount**: Default borrowing amount (default: 5 ETH)
- **Auto Execution**: Enable/disable automatic trade execution

### Safety Features
- **Slippage Protection**: Configurable slippage tolerance (default: 5%)
- **Gas Price Monitoring**: Automatic transaction skipping during high gas periods
- **Balance Verification**: Pre-execution balance and allowance checks
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic restart and error handling mechanisms

## üìä Performance Monitoring

The bot provides comprehensive logging and monitoring:
- Real-time opportunity detection and profit calculations
- Gas usage and transaction success/failure tracking
- Performance metrics and execution statistics
- Detailed error logs for debugging and optimization

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- **Access Control**: Proper validation of flash loan initiators
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Safe external calls and state management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking and bounds verification
- **Flash Loan Compliance**: Strict adherence to ERC-3156 standard

### Bot Security
- **Private Key Management**: Secure environment variable handling
- **RPC Endpoint Security**: Configurable RPC providers with API key protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to prevent API throttling
- **Transaction Simulation**: Pre-execution validation to prevent failed transactions

## üìö Educational Value
